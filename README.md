# Malware Detection System for IoT Environments

## Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized modern convenience through the integration of interconnected devices. However, this interconnectedness also brings forth complex cybersecurity challenges, particularly the threat of malware exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT networks. Our project addresses these challenges by developing a sophisticated Malware Detection System (MDS) specifically designed for IoT environments. This system not only identifies and neutralizes known malware but also anticipates and counters emerging threats, thereby enhancing the security of IoT ecosystems.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to create a resilient and adaptive malware detection system capable of protecting IoT devices and networks from malicious attacks. Our approach focuses on understanding the unique characteristics of IoT environments and utilizing machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent malware in real-time.
